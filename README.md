## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the files relating to the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project. These files include a R script called run_anlaysis.R that can be run as long as the Samsung data. A tidy dataset (tidy.txt)  that aggregates the numeric values grouping by subject and activity is also attached. Also, a README.md introduction and a code book (CodeBook.md) are included in the repository that describe the raw data, the steps of transformation, as well as a guide to the variables and values in the dataset.
